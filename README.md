# maddog

A suite of tools for dealing with a directory of markdown files.

IDEA: just markdown? todo logic might be useful outside that?

TODO: decide on a more permanent name, maddog/md/mddir

TODO: this is an example of a todo due in the past {by:2024-07-01}

TODO: this is an example of a todo with other tags {tag:example}

DONE: two tags fields and status is done {tag:example} {by:2024-01-01}
